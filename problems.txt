for a, where a = 2^i (i = range such that 2^i<total blocks)
for x such that x*a < total blocks
	x is mapped to a random leaf node, following normal path oram;
	Then, to access the range x to x+2^i, you read the leaf node paths
	in bit reverse lexographic order from the leaf of x, and each one of
	these paths will have a block in the range we want.

-Remeber to encrypt initialized buckets after working.\

batch_eviction:
-For each level read 2^i buckets in BRL
	-if block found is not in stash, put it in.
From bottom up, for each path, if a block is in that path, fill up the bucket and then move to the next bucket.

Write back.

Questions:
	-on initialization, only dummy blocks are assigned.
	-What happens if the block starting a range, a power of 2, doesn't exist.

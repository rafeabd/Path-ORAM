Path ORAM Pseudocode
Data Structures
Stash: A small local memory that temporarily holds blocks.

Position Map: A dictionary that maps each block to a random leaf in the ORAM tree.

ORAM Tree: A binary tree where each node is a bucket that can hold a fixed number of blocks.

Parameters
N: Number of blocks in the ORAM.

Z: Number of blocks each bucket can hold.

L: Height of the ORAM tree (L = log N).


Step 1: Steal or write code for binary tree
Step 2: Stash block in binary tree buckets
